<h4>3. Known Issues</h4>
<!-- Include instrument functionality not supported by the driver or known issues as necessary. -->
<para>
To report issues or provide feedback about this instrument driver, please send an email to <a href="mailto:instrument.drivers@ni.com">instrument.drivers@ni.com</a>.</para>
<br>
<ol>
<li>Not all VIs are supported by all instrument models.  This is documented throughout the instrument driver.  Refer to instrument documentation for more details pertaining to your specific model. <br>
<li>The TDS 5000 series instruments do not support histogram measurements, despite being listed in the manual.<br>
<li>For the older TDS models, models intermittently failed to process commands when multiple commands were issued. To address this issue delays were added after the VISA writes. This might not be an issue with the newer models.<br>
<li>Tektronix sometimes may update firmware which might not be backwards compatible. If you can not use Configure Trigger (Window).vi and Configure Trigger (Video).vi, please update the firmware to the latest version.
<li>Although all trigger VIs are implemented in the driver, not all of them have been tested with the live instrument. The VIs that haven't been tested are the ones that relative with VIDeo, I2C, CAN, SPI, RS232 trigger type.
