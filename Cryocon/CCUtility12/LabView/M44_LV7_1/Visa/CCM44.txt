NAME
	CCM44 - LabView driver for the Cryocon Model 44 temperature controller
		using the RS232 and IEEE-488 interface.
		       *****LabView 7.1*****
SYNOPSIS
	VIs have a prefix 'CC'.

DESCRIPTION
	The Model 44 is a four-channel cryogenic temperature controller with
	100/10 Base-T Ethernet, serial (RS-232) and GPIB (IEEE-488.2) remote interfaces. 
	The serial and GPIB interfaces use the 'Visa' libraries and the
	Ethernet interface uses the TCP libraries.
